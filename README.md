Internship

 Objective:
To learn and implement classification models using Decision Trees and Random Forests, understand how they work, evaluate their performance, and interpret their outputs (like feature importance and tree structure).

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
          scikit-learn (for model building)
          
          matplotlib, seaborn (for plotting and visualization)
          
          Graphviz or sklearn.tree.plot_tree (for visualizing the decision tree)

 Step-by-Step Tasks:
1. Train a Decision Tree Classifier:
          Load and preprocess your dataset (e.g., Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle).
          
          Use DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree.
          
          Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
          
          Train the decision tree on the training data.
          
          Predict and evaluate the model using accuracy or classification report.

2. Visualize the Decision Tree:
          Use plot_tree() or export it using Graphviz to visually understand the structure and decision flow.
          
          Make sure feature names and class names are shown.

3. Analyze Overfitting & Control Tree Depth:
               Decision trees can overfit the training data.
               
               Control tree complexity using hyperparameters like:
               
               max_depth
               
               min_samples_split
               
               min_samples_leaf
               
               Plot accuracy for both training and testing sets at different depths to visualize overfitting.

4. Train a Random Forest Classifier:
             Use RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble.
             
             Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees and typically performs better.
             
             Train on the same data and compare performance with the single Decision Tree.

5. Interpret Feature Importances:
            Extract and plot feature_importances_ from the Random Forest model.
            
            This tells you which features contribute most to the prediction.
            
            Useful for understanding the model and reducing dimensions.

6. Evaluate Using Cross-Validation:
            Use cross_val_score to evaluate model stability.
            
            Compare average cross-validation scores between Decision Tree and Random Forest.
            
            This helps confirm which model generalizes better.
